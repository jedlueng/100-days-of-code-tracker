Organizing Files 
- Copies pdf in every sub-folders 
- Remove zeroes in filenames 
- Compress several folders into on ZIP 



The shutil Module 
- copy,move, rename and delete files 


Copying Files and Folders 
- shutil.copy(source, destination)
    copy file at the path source to the destination 
    (string)


{shutil.copy}

#Copy spam.txt to delicious directory 
#copy eggs.txt to delicious\\eggs2.txt  ***Change file name to eggs2.txt


shutil.copytree(source,destination) > copy entire folder and every folder and file contained in it



Moving and Renaming Files and Folders 


shutil.move(source,destination)


{shutil.move} 



{shutil.move2}
#The source file is move and rename
 

{shutil.move3}
#bacon.txt is rename to eggs because there's no destination folder




Permanently Deleting Files and Folders 

to delete single file or emply folders 
    os module is used 

os.unlink(path) > delete file path 
os.rmdir(path) < delete the folder at path 
shutil.rmtree(path) > remove the folder at path, and all files and folders it contains 



{ endswith}

#Use for loop, if filename endswith .rxt, delete it 






Safe Deletes with the send2trash Module 

- shutil.rmtree() = irreversibly deletes files  and folders. 
    Dangerous to use 

- send2trash > send folders and files to computer's trash 

{send2trash}

#send2trash.send2trash(file)




_____________________________

 Walking a Directory Tree 

- for rename everyfile and every subfolder of that folder 

{directory-Tree}




os.walk() 


{oswalk1()}

{oswalk2()}

#Use loop statement to walk a directory tree 
#range() functionn  to walk over a range of numbers 
#os.walk() will return 3 values 
    1. A string of the current folder's name 
    2.A list of strings of the folders in the current folder 
    3.. A list of strings of the files in the current folder 


{os.walk-result}

#os.walk() returns lists of strings for the subfolder and filename

Compressing Files with the zipfile Module 

- reduce size 
- can contain multiple files and subfolders. 
archive file  

Reading ZIP Files 

1. Create a ZipFile object (zipfile.Zipfile(file))
2. Use method on the zipfile 


{zip1}

#zipfile.namelist() > list content of this zipfile object 
#fileobject.file_zize > fileobject.compress_size = find size 

1.calculates efficientcy of zip file 

#zipfile is the same as file, you need to open and close. 





Extracting from ZIP Files 


{extractall}

#zipfileobject.extractall() > extracts all the files and folders to current working directory
#or .extractall(path)




{extract}

#zipfile.extract(file,path)

#This will extract a single file 




Creating and Adding to ZIP files 

{zip2}

1. open Zipfile object with write mode 
2. zipfile.write(file, compress_type)
    compress_type is the type of algorithum 

#This will create a new ZIP file name new.zip that has the compressed contetnts of spam.txt
